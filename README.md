For the Code files</br>
So far, our code  is not yet in production, we are still writing the code and tesing the code though our server.</br>
<h3>To run the code:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>first install the files in MobaXterm in the var/www/html </li>
  <li>modify the init file to your local server with your username and password </li>
  <li>make sure the etc/apacha2/site-enable has the omeka.conf file, if you don't have this file then you can create the file with the path to the omeka folder</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pointers:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure to install the plugins once using the omeka page</li>
  <li>Make sure imagemagick is installed and the correct path is added to the setting</li>
  <li>Check if HTML filter is turned off in setting --> secrity</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Page Modifications: </h3>
 <li> the plugin 'Simple page' can be use to create more pages and these pages could be modify using HTML. CSS can be added using the <style tag></li>
