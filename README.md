For the Code files
So far, our code  is not yet in production, we are still writing the code and tesing the code though our server.
To run the code:
  -first install the files in MobaXterm in the var/www/html 
  -modify the init file to your local server with your username and password
  -make sure the etc/apacha2/site-enable has the omeka.conf file, if you don't have this file then you can create the file with the path to    the omeka folder

Pointers:
  -Make sure to install the plugins once using the omeka page
  -Make sure imagemagick is installed and the correct path is added to the setting
  -Check if HTML filter is turned off in setting --> secrity
